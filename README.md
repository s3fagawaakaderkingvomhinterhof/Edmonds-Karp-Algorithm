# Edmonds-Karp-Algorithm
Implementation of Edmonds-Karp-Algorithm
The Edmonds-Karp-Algorithm (EK) is an Algorithm for Solving the Max-Flow-Problem for a directed graph.

Input:
Given is a drirected graph. It is represented as an adjacency matrix.
 
Output:
Is the adjacency matrix of the Maximal-Flow.

Problem description for short:
A graph is a set of two other sets. On set are the vertices named like: "Berlin", "01", "v1", one vertice is a bubble with a given name.
The other one is the set of edges, an edge is the connection between two. This connection has a capacity and a direction. The goal is to search a path with using the biggest possible value for each edge that the flow is valid. A more detailed but german explanation is in Theory.pdf.
